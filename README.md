## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies

### 2. Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. In GitHub, open **Settings → Pages**.
2. Set **Source** to **GitHub Actions**.
3. Push to `main` to trigger deployment.

> **Note:** The GitHub Actions workflow currently uses `npm install` because this repository does not include a `package-lock.json` yet. Once a lockfile is added, we can switch back to `npm ci` for more repeatable builds.

Your deployed site URL will be:
`https://turiedmonds.github.io/RUAfit/`
